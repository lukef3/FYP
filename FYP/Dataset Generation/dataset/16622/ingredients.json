        "400gms (or more, if you like your meat) of chicken thighs \u2013 I\u2019ve boned mine, but keeping the bone in adds additional flavour \u2013 If I were using lamb, I\u2019d leave the bones as marrow is wonderful in a biryani!",
        "100gms plain yoghurt",
        "4 cloves of garlic, crushed",
        "1 cm ginger, grated/minced",
        "1 chilli, chopped (optional \u2013 fresh is best, but I couldn\u2019t source any, so used a dried chilli)",
        "Juice of 1 lemon",
        "2 tsps coriander powder",
        "1 tsp cumin powder",
        "1/2 tsp ground Cayenne Pepper",

        "1 tsp salt (or to taste)",
        "1 tsp cracked pepper (or to taste)",
        "1 cup of milk (whole milk gives the best flavour, but skim milk is also fine)",
        "1 large onion, thinly sliced",
        "1 1/2 cups of basmati rice, washed",
        "2 bay leaves",
        "a handful of mint leaves (again, couldn\u2019t source fresh leaves, so going with dried, but not quite the same!)",
        "1 tsp cumin seeds (if you can get black cumin, this is best, but normal cumin is also ok)",

        "3 cms of cinnamon sticks",
        "12 peppercorns",
        "6 cloves",
        "A pinch of saffron strands (Ok, this is meant to be a decadent dish, hence the saffron \u2013 it\u2019s expensive, but needed to get the full flavour and colour)",

        "2 tsp Salt (or to taste)",
        "Oil/ghee"
