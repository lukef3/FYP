        "5\u00a0eggs, preferably pastured",
        "1/4 tsp sea salt",
        "1 tsp vanilla extract",
        "1/2 cup milk of choice (I used coconut, which gives a heartier texture and a faintly sweet flavor, but almond would work really well too)",
        "1 small loaf (about 12 slices) sourdough bread, sliced",
        "1/4 cup coconut sugar (which you'll be using 1 tsp at a time, so 12 tsp)",
        "High heat oil, for pan-frying (avocado, ghee and coconut oil all work well)"
