        "1 1/2 lbs boneless beef belly (brisket), rinsed well under cool water, patted dry, and then cut into 1.5 x 1.5 inch cubes (Note:  You want a fatty cut of beef.  Pieces consisting of 50% of connective tissue and fat will be the most flavourful and tender.  I usually get cuts of meat that consist of 30% fat to be healthier, but the leaner pieces will be a bit dry.  Don\u2019t substitute with leaner cuts of meat or the meat will be dry.)",
