        "3 teaspoons canola oil, divided (I used olive oil and it worked well)",
        "1 14-ounce package firm water-packed tofu, rinsed and crumbled (I used extra firm tofu to keep more of the \u201ctofu\u201d consistency\u201d and less of the \u201ccrumble\u201d effect \u2013 I also cubed most of the tofu and only crumbled a bit)",
        "1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder (I think I ended up using about 3 tsp chili powder)",
        "1 teaspoon ground cumin (I used about 2-2.5 tsp cumin)",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt, divided (I ended up using about 3/4 tsp total)",
        "1/4 package taco seasoning (I added this to amp up the flavor. I\u2019d also suggest adding a pinch of cayenne if you like things with a little more spice!)",
        "1 small zucchini, diced (I actually used 4-5 small zucchini)",
        "3/4 cup frozen corn, thawed",
        "1 red bell pepper, diced (I added this)",
        "4 scallions, sliced",
        "1/2 red onion diced (I added this)",
        "1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (I used shredded cheddar because that\u2019s what we had on hand)",
        "1/2 cup prepared salsa",
        "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro",
        "1 15 oz can black beans, rinsed and drained",
