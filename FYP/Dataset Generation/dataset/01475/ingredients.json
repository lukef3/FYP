    "ingredients": [
        "4-5 pounds pork shoulder",
        "15 dried Guajillo chiles (these are quite mild chiles, so if you want something a bit spicier, I suggest you go for it)",
        "6-8 cups hot water (for soaking the chiles in)",
        "4 cloves garlic, peeled",
        "2\u00bd teaspoons oregano",
        "\u00bd teaspoon cumin",
        "\u00bd teaspoon Kosher salt",
        "\u00bc teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)",
        "1 pound fresh tomatillos (alternatively, you can use the pre-roasted tomatillos in a can)",
        "1 shallot (or \u00bc an onion), peeled and cut in half",
        "4 cloves garlic, unpeeled",
        "2-3 jalapeno peppers (I used 2; if you like it spicy, use 3, if you like it mild, use 1)",
        "a large handful of cilantro",
        "juice of \u00bd a lime",
        "\u215b teaspoon Kosher salt",
        "\u215b teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "1\u2153 cup shortening",
        "4 cups masa mix (I used the Maseca brand, which I highly recommend - please note that this is not just corn flour, it is masa mix made from cornmeal)",
        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 teaspoon Kosher salt",
        "4 cups good quality broth (I used a stock that I made and froze from my Thanksgiving turkey, but you can use any high quality broth, such as beef broth, as long as it isn't low-sodium or anything like that. You want your masa to be full of FLAVOR!)",
        "60 dried corn husks (this is more than you need, but you will need extras for tying the tamales with and it's good to have some extras in case you mess up)",
        "prepared masa (recipe above)",
        "4-5 pounds roasted pork (recipe above)",
        "2 cups salsa verde (recipe above - feel free to use store bought salsa if you're short on time)"
