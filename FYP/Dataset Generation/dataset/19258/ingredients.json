        "1 container plain soy or other vegan yogurt",
        "2 tsp garam masala spice mix (Available at most major grocery stores. Once you have it on hand, you\u2019ll frequently find yourself reaching for it to add depth to everyday veggie sides.)",
        "1 clove crushed or mashed garlic",
        "1/2 teaspoon ginger paste",
        "Juice of 1/2 lime (This is to recreate the tanginess missing from soy yogurt.)",

        "1 cup water",
        "Enough olive or coconut oil to thinly coat the bottom of your pan",
        "1 small onion, diced",
        "2 cloves garlic",
        "1 tsp ginger paste",
        "At least 1 tablespoon garam masala (You can also use curry powder in a pinch, but the flavor will be less authentic.)",
        "5 or 6 tomatoes, chopped",
        "1 tablespoon tomato paste",
        "1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (completely optional, but I find this adds extra depth)",
