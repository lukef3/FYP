        "1/4 cup white sugar",
        "1/4 cup brown sugar",
        "1 tablespoon cinnamon",
        "2 sheets bought frozen puff pastry, thawed but cold",
        "2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, cooled",
        "6 tablespoons chopped toasted walnuts",
        "1/2 cup dark chocolate chips",
        "1 cup powdered sugar",
        "2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
        "2 tablespoon half and half",
        "Think ahead when using store-bought puff pastry. The best way to do so is by tossing the pastry from the freezer to the fridge before you go to sleep. It will be perfect in the morning.",
        "To toast nuts, I usually scatter the nuts on a baking sheet and place them in an oven between 300 and 350\u00b0F for 10 minutes. You can also toast them in a dry pan. When you can smell them and they begin to get golden cheeks, they're ready. I often toast more then I need, then store them in the freezer to keep them from spoiling.",

        "Use great quality dark chocolate chips here. You'll notice the difference. They are the star of the show.",
        "As I always say, if you want to make your own cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche cheaply at home, simply stir together equal parts heavy cream and sour cream, and let stand in the fridge overnight.",
