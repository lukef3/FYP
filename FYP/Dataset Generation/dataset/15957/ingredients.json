        "4 fresh poblano chiles, roasted (see TIPS AND TRICKS: How to roast chilies and peppers in the oven)",
        "18, 6 inch corn tortillas, halved",
        "1/4 cup olive oil",
        "10 ounces fresh spinach",
        "course salt",
        "1 onion, thinly sliced",
        "4 garlic cloves, minced",
        "1 cup black beans, cooked",
        "1 cup mexican crema or sour cream, plus some for serving (mexican crema is similar to sour cream but has added salt and is a bit thinner... so I usually use sour cream that I have thinned with a bit of milk and then add some salt)",
        "2 1/4 cups tomatillo salsa (here's a recipe for homemade tomatillo salsa or you can use store-bought, if you use the homemade I would suggest putting it in a blender until smooth)",
        "1 1/2 cups mexican crumbling cheese"
