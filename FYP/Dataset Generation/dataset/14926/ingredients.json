        "8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced",
        "Splash of white wine",
        "Salt to taste",
        "1 6 to 7 oz jar (depending on what you can find or like) of sun-dried tomato pesto",
        "1 lb of dried pasta (I like a rotini or fusilli with this because those corkscrews just capture all of the goodness!)",
        "Splash of olive oil, for finishing (herb infused olive oil is even better!)",
        "Freshly grated parmesan to sprinkle on top"
